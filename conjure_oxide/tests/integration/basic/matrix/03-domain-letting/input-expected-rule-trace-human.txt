Model before rewriting:

letting MATRIX be domain matrix indexed by [[int(1..3), int(1..2)]] of int(1..3)
find a: MATRIX

such that

(a[[1, 1]] = 1),
(a[[2, 2]] = 1)

--

(a[[1, 1]] = 1),
(a[[2, 2]] = 1), 
   ~~> substitute_domain_lettings ([("Base", 5000)]) 
(a[[1, 1]] = 1),
(a[[2, 2]] = 1) 

--

Final model:

letting MATRIX be domain matrix indexed by [[int(1..3), int(1..2)]] of int(1..3)
find a: matrix indexed by [[int(1..3), int(1..2)]] of int(1..3)

such that

(a[[1, 1]] = 1),
(a[[2, 2]] = 1)
